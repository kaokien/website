# Power of Inversion

Considering the opposite of oneâ€™s goal is called inversion.

Stoics believed that imaging the worst case scenario ahead of time would allow them to overcome their fears.

German mathematician Carl Jacobi believed that one of the best ways to clarify thinking is to restate the problem in inverse form.

Avoiding mistake is an under-appreciated form of improvement.

There is power being able to consider the opposite side, ensure that is continuously done.

Examples of Inversion:

Focusing on what to keep (instead of what to discard)
Imagining a long-term goal failing (think of what may cause failure)
How do I end up distracted (eliminate distractions instead of consuming productivity videos)
Figure out how to not lose money (instead of how to make money)
